# Favorite_Restaurant_Website

This repository is created for an assignment for Tech Talent South. It is a basic website designed using HTML5 exclusively, to demostrate knowledge that has been gained through the Day 4 lecture on HTML. Some of the things that I have demonstrated while working on this project include:

* Creating an html page
* utilizing the div tags
* creating links to various pages
* Creating a table
* Creating Lists
* Creating a form
* Creating a second html page and linking it to the first
     
Along with a return link back to the main page.
These skill are vital to creating a basic web page. I have also set it up so that a CSS file can be added to it.
